🚀 Business Problem
Target aims to optimize its Brazilian market operations by addressing key questions:

Which states contribute the most to revenue growth?

How diverse are payment methods across orders?

What factors impact delivery time and overall customer satisfaction?

📊 Key Business Insights
1️⃣ Regional Sales Performance
São Paulo (SP) leads in order volume and customer engagement, showing a promising business outlook.

Growth trajectory indicates a strong revenue increase in 2019, following upward order trends.

Target’s customer base is concentrated in SP, with limited penetration across other Brazilian states.
